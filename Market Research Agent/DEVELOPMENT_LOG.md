# Market Research Automation Project - Development Log

## Project Overview
This document tracks the development process and conversations related to the Market Research Automation project using CrewAI.

## Development Timeline

### Initial Project Setup (July 10, 2025)

#### Project Structure Created
- Created basic project structure with necessary directories:
  - `agents/`: For CrewAI agent definitions
  - `tools/`: For custom data collection tools
  - `utils/`: For utility functions
  - `market_research.py`: Main script

#### Files Created
1. `requirements.txt`
   - Added necessary dependencies:
     - crewai>=0.11.0
     - langchain>=0.1.0
     - pandas>=2.0.0
     - python-dotenv>=1.0.0
     - google-generativeai>=0.3.0
     - newsapi-python>=0.2.7
     - yfinance>=0.2.36
     - matplotlib>=3.7.0
     - plotly>=5.18.0

2. `README.md`
   - Added project documentation
   - Included setup instructions
   - Listed project structure and requirements

3. `agents/research_agents.py`
   - Implemented three main agents:
     - Research Manager
     - Data Analyst
     - Industry Expert

4. `tools/market_tools.py`
   - Created tools for:
     - Market news retrieval
     - Stock data collection

5. `utils/helpers.py`
   - Implemented utility functions:
     - `process_news_data()`: Converts news articles to DataFrame
     - `create_stock_plot()`: Generates stock price visualizations
     - `save_report()`: Saves research results
     - `load_report()`: Loads previous reports

6. `market_research.py`
   - Created main script to orchestrate the research process
   - Implemented crew setup and task definitions

### Discussion Points

#### Utility Functions Discussion
Q: "What's the role of utility function. I mean helpers.py file?"

A: The `helpers.py` file contains utility functions that support the main functionality:
1. `process_news_data()`: Converts raw news articles into structured DataFrames
2. `create_stock_plot()`: Creates stock price visualizations
3. `save_report()`: Handles saving research results
4. `load_report()`: Manages loading previous reports

These functions serve as the "glue" between different parts of the system by:
- Converting data between different formats
- Creating visualizations
- Handling data persistence
- Providing reusable functionality

## Next Steps
- [ ] Add more data sources
- [ ] Implement error handling
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Create example reports
- [ ] Add documentation for API usage

## Notes
- Project is designed to be beginner-friendly
- Code includes detailed comments
- Modular structure for easy maintenance
- Error handling implemented throughout
